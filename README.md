### Dataset

> The data set at hand includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area, we will analyze it in order to find out the behavior of diffrent users

> we have 183412 instances with 18 features,we have 7 object datatypes indicating days of the week, genders and user types, and 8 numerical datatypes, and 2 datetime datatypes

> we are mainly intersted in user type and duration in seconds 

> we fixed the datatype of the dates column in the dataset also we added an age column 


### Summary of findings

> for our first analysis we found out for user type we noticed that 90% of our users are subscribers for trip duration we find that a lot of the users ride their bikes dor a period of just 15 minutes

> for the second part we found that a clear relation between the type of our users and the average length of the ride corresponding to the type, aslo we discovered that customers tend to not share their rides

> after our third and final part we found that after further examination of the week days and the duration feature we found that nearlly the average ride time for the subscriber is constant throught out the week but for the customer it is not the same case at all, the average time for the customers is at his peak in the weekends

> as for conclusion I think our main takeaway from this dataset is that the behaviour and the time spent during the rides is diffrent for the subscribers and the customers, subscribers ride less throught out the week while our customers tend to ride alot throught out the week and specially in the weekends, we have driven new feature and a lot of plots to help us reach a data driven conclusion


### ket insights for presentation

> we were intersted in knowing how the age factor affect our users and so on how it affect their behavior so we ploted a relation to view age distribution 

> Also how much each user spends on his ride or in other way the average time users spend on their bikes this will be helpfull in knowing how will we approach users for further analysis so we ploted a relation to view trip duration distribution

> And we needed to know what is the most comman day diffrent users use so we can make  a recommedation to take certain action in that day so we ploted a relation to find out percent of users riding in each day

> also as we now know which days are more popular than others we needed to know if the average ride time increases in that day or not so we ploted a relation to find out average ride time in each day
